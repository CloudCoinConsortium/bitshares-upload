# STEPS TO GET ON BITSHARES

1. Setup your own Testnet Delayed Node
2. Testnet Bitshares Watcher (staggered orders that will be collected from your uploads)
3. Implement Gateway functionalities (On-Off ramp to BitShares)
4. Once you connect on-off to the issuer of dummy cloudcoin, script can handle transfers internally your BTS testnet account is issuing tokens/transfer to users on BTS testnet doing upload of CloudCoins through your app - real cloudcoins

So, on one side - BTS testnet delayed node and watcher + script
on other side - Ropsten Testnet ETH node + watcher + script
